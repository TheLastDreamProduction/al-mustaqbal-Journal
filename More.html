                Ethical Guidelines for Publishing :
            </p>
            <p>
                The guidelines contained in this document have been revised by the Future Journal of Law.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Introduction
            </p>
            <p>
                Future Journal for Humanities serves society as a whole in several ways, including publishing research 
                and the editorial board of the journal is responsible for setting and maintaining the guiding principles for the selection and acceptance of papers submitted to that journal. The editorial board derives these principles
                 generally from the journal's definition of its scope and the editorial board's perception of the standards of quality and sustainability of scientific work and its presentation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This journal stems from a desire to identify perceived benefits to society and the profession as a whole and to limit actions that may serve the narrow self-interest of 
                individuals. The advancement of science requires the exchange of knowledge between individuals, although doing so may sometimes entail giving up some immediate personal advantages.  
            </p>
            <p>
                With these ideas in mind, the editorial board of the journal provides a set 
                of ethical guidelines for people involved in the publication of papers, specifically
                 for editorial staff and authors. These guidelines are presented not in the sense that there is
                  any immediate crisis in ethical conduct, but from the conviction that observing high ethical standards is vital for the entire journal and should be brought to the attention of all concerned to these standards. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that most of the guidelines now presented are already understood and shared by most experienced researchers. However, it may be of great benefit to those relatively new to research.
