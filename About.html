                The Journal of Human Sciences and Political Science is a scholarly publication dedicated to advancing knowledge and understanding in
                the intersecting domains of human sciences and political science. Our journal serves as a prominent platform for researchers, academics, 
                and practitioners from diverse disciplines to contribute to the exploration of the intricate relationship between human behavior, societal structures, and political systems.
