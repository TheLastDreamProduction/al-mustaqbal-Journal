                Submission Process: Journal of Human Sciences and Political Science

                The Journal of Human Sciences and Political Science welcomes submissions of original research articles, 
                theoretical studies, empirical analyses, and methodological innovations that explore the intersection between human 
                sciences and political science. Our submission process is designed to be efficient, transparent, and supportive of authors
                 throughout the publication journey. Below is an overview of our detailed submissions process:
            </p>
            <p>
                1.Manuscript Preparation: Authors should ensure their manuscripts 
                adhere to the journal's guidelines, which can be found on our website. This 
                includes formatting requirements, citation style, and ethical considerations. 
                The guidelines provide authors with clear instructions on how to structure their articles and prepare them for review.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.Online Submission: To submit a manuscript, authors should visit our online submission system, accessible via our website. The system guides authors
                 through the submission process, step-by-step. Authors will be required to 
                 provide information such as the manuscript title, abstract, keywords, and the names and affiliations of all contributing authors.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.Peer Review: Upon submission, manuscripts undergo a rigorous peer-review process. Our Editorial Board assigns the manuscript to experts in the field who assess 
                its quality, originality, methodology, and significance. The peer-review process ensures 
                the highest academic standards and helps authors refine their work through constructive feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.Decision Notification: After the peer-review process is complete, authors will receive a decision notification via email. The decision can take several forms: acceptance, minor 
                revisions, major revisions, or rejection. In cases where revisions are requested, authors are given specific feedback to address before resubmitting their revised manuscript.
            </p>
            <p>
                5.Revision and Resubmission: If revisions are requested, authors are encouraged to carefully consider the feedback provided by the reviewers and make the necessary revisions to their manuscript. 
                The revised version should be submitted within the specified timeframe, along with a detailed response addressing each reviewer's comments and explaining the changes made.
            </p>
            <p>
                6.Copyediting and Production: Once a manuscript is accepted for publication, it undergoes copyediting to ensure adherence to style, grammar, and formatting guidelines. Authors may be requested to review and 
                approve the edited version. 
                The accepted articles are then prepared for online publication, where they will be assigned a digital object identifier (DOI) for proper identification and citation.
            </p>
            <p>
                7.Online Publication: Accepted articles are published online, making them immediately accessible to readers worldwide through the journal's website. The Online First section allows readers to access articles even 
                before the formal print or final online version of the journal is released. This ensures timely dissemination of research findings to the academic community.
            </p>
            <p>
                8.Indexing and Archiving: The Journal of Human Sciences and Political Science strives to have its content indexed in reputable databases and repositories, increasing the visibility and discoverability of published 
                articles. This includes indexing in databases 
                such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, among others. Archiving of articles is also undertaken to preserve the journal's content for future reference.
            </p>
            <p>
                We encourage researchers, scholars, and practitioners to submit their work to the Journal of Human Sciences and Political Science. By following our submissions process, 
                authors have the opportunity to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of human sciences and political science and engage in meaningful scholarly discussions.

                We look forward to receiving your submissions and joining you on the journey of expanding our understanding of human behavior, societal structures, and political systems.

                Principles and Guidelines  

                I.Obligations of the Editorial Board  

                1.The Commission shall consider all research submitted for publication, and each
                 shall be judged based on its merits regardless of race, religion, nationality,
                  gender, seniority, or institutional affiliation of the author(s). However, the 
                  editor may immediately consider the research relationships without considering them with 
                  others previously or simultaneously submitted by the same author(s). 
            </p>
            <p>
                2.The sole responsibility for accepting or rejecting the research lies with the editor.  The responsible and prudent practice of this requires that the editor seek advice from experts, who have been selected, regarding the credibility and reliability of the research submitted for publication.  However, research may be rejected without external review if the editorial board deems it unsuitable for the journal.
                 This rejection may be based on the failure of
                  the research to fit the scope of the journal, to be of sufficient current or broad relevance, to provide sufficient depth to the content, or for other reasons. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3.The editor must consider the research submitted for publication at a reasonable speed.

                4.Members of the editorial board should not disclose any information related to the research under consideration to anyone other than those from whom professional advice is sought.
            </p>
            <p>
                5.The editor-in-chief and members of the editorial board may disclose or publish the titles of research papers and the names of the authors of works 
                that have been accepted for publication, but the information may not be shared casually unless the author's express permission is obtained.  
                If the editorial board decides that the research is not suitable for publication in the 
                journal for scientific reasons, it may then transfer the research to an alternative journal.  
            </p>
            <p>
                6.The editorial board must respect the intellectual independence of authors.

                7.Responsibility and editorial authority must be delegated to any research authored by a member of the board or by colleagues in the same institution wishing to be published in 
                the journal and submitted by the editorial board to the expert committee to decide
                 whether the research is valid. Consideration by the editorial board of such research in any way would constitute a conflict of interest and therefore considered inappropriate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                8.Unpublished information or explanations disclosed in the research submitted by the researcher should only be used with his written consent. However,
                 if this information suggests that some of the author's research is unlikely to be financially rewarding, the editorial board can ethically stop the work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                9.If the submitted research is related to current or previous research of a member of the
                 editorial board and in order not to create a conflict of interest, it is appropriate to inform the author about the editorial board's research and plans in this field. 
            </p>
            <p>
                10.If convincing evidence is provided to the editorial board that the main content or
                 conclusions of research published in the journal are incorrect, the editorial board should 
                 facilitate the publication of an appropriate report indicating that error and, if possible, correct it.    
            </p>
            <p>
                11.The author may request the editorial board not to use certain experts in the consideration of the research. However, 
                the editorial board may decide to use one or more of these reviewers, if the board feels that their opinions are important in
                 the fair consideration of the research.  This may be the case, for example, when research seriously disagrees with the previous work of a potential expert. 
            </p>
            <p>
                II.Moral obligations of the author 
                Authors are expected to adhere to the following ethical
                 guidelines set out below which may result in the application of sanctions by the editorial board, including but not limited to the suspension or revocation of publication privileges. 
            </p>
            <p>
                1.The author should provide accurate and complete details of the research carried out, avoiding deception altogether, including the data collected or used,
                 as well as an objective discussion of the importance of the research. The data is identified as information collected or used to generate research conclusions. The research 
                report and the data collected should contain sufficient detail and an indication of general sources of information to allow the trained professional to reproduce the observations. 
            </p>
            <p>
                2.The author must realize that journal space is a valuable resource created at a great cost. Therefore, the author is obliged to use it wisely and economically. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3.The author must cite those publications that have had the effect of determining the nature of the reported work and that 
                will quickly direct the reader to the previous work necessary to understand the current investigation. Work citations that will not be referenced in the reported search 
                should be minimized. The author is obliged to conduct a literature search to find and then cite
                 original publications describing the closely related work.  For critical materials used in the work, appropriate quotations should also be made to sources when they are provided by a non-author. 
            </p>
            <p>
                4.It is inappropriate for a researcher to submit the same research to more than one journal for publication unless the research is rejected or withdrawn from publication. 
            </p>
            <p>
                5.Authors are encouraged to recommend appropriate reviewers during the submission of the paper. However,
                 they do not suggest reviewers who have an actual, perceived, or potential conflict of interest. Furthermore, authors should not suggest
                 reviewers with whom they share a personal or professional relationship if there is a possibility that this relationship will introduce bias in the evaluation of the research. 
            </p>
            <p>
                6.The author must determine the source of all information quoted or displayed, except as known to all. Information that is published privately, 
                such as in conversation, correspondence, or discussion with a third party, should not be used or reported in the author's work without the express permission of the investigator with whom the information originated. 
                Information obtained at the Office of Secret Services, such as research arbitration or grant applications, should be treated similarly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                7.Empirical or theoretical study may sometimes justify criticism, and even extreme criticism, of the work of 
                another scientist. Where appropriate, such criticism may be presented in published papers. However, personal criticism is by no means appropriate. 
            </p>
            <p>
                8.The co-authors of the paper should be all people who have made significant scientific contributions to the reported work and who share responsibility and 
                accountability for the results. Authors must appropriately recognize the
                 contributions of technical staff and data specialists.  Other contributions should be indicated in a footnote or the "Acknowledgements" section.   
            </p>
            <p>
                9.The author must disclose to the editorial board and readers of the journal any actual or potential conflict of interest 
                of any of the authors that may be related to the publication of the results contained in the research during submission. All 
                authors must declare (1) sources of funding for the reported research, (2) the existence of any significant financial interest
                 in companies or business entities that have a financial or other interest in the manuscript results, (3) any employment or other 
                 relationship (within the last three years) with entities that have a financial or other interest in the manuscript results 
                 (including but not limited to paid consultations, expert testimony, fees, patent interests, or Membership of advisory boards or committees).
                  Financial interests are included in the published article. Authors must also disclose to the editorial board any non-financial possibility or
                   perceived conflict of interest that, in their view, may affect the publication process. 
            </p>
            <p>
                10.Plagiarism is not acceptable in the journal. ( ) is committed to defining plagiarism as (appropriation of someone else's ideas, processes, results, or words) 
                authors must not engage in plagiarism—verbatim or quasi-verbatim reproduction, or paraphrasing too close, to a text or results from another work. Authors must not engage 
                in self-plagiarism (also known as duplicate publishing) – unacceptably replicating previously published text or results of the author without acknowledging the source. It is
                 unacceptable for an author to include verbatim or semi-literal parts of his work, or to portray his previously published findings or methodology as new, without acknowledging the source.  
            </p>
            <p>
                11.Images in the search must be free from misleading manipulation. 
                 When they are cited or in data collection as part of the research, the researcher is prompted for an accurate description of how the images were obtained.  
            </p>
            <p>
                III.Ethical obligations of the Committee of Experts :
            </p>
            <p>
                1.As much as research review is an essential step in the publication process, each expert is obliged to do a fair share of the review. 
                2.The selected expert who feels that he is not sufficiently qualified to judge the reported research should immediately return it to the editor.
                3.Experts should judge the quality of research objectively, including empirical and theoretical data and explanations,
                 with due regard to maintaining high scientific and literary standards. The reviewer must respect the intellectual independence of the authors. 
            </p>
            <p>
                4.The expert should be sensitive to the emergence of a conflict of interest when the research under review is closely related to the expert's ongoing or published work. 
                 In case of doubt, the expert must immediately re-examine without review, and inform the editorial board of the conflict of interest or bias. 
            </p>
            <p>
                5.The expert must not evaluate a manuscript that has been authored or co
                -authored by a person with whom he has a personal or professional relationship if 
                the relationship would prejudice the judgment of the research. 
            </p>
            <p>
                6.Confidentiality throughout the editorial review process to allow for frank discussion and evaluation regarding the submitted scientific content. This confidentiality
                 is independent of the final decision on the research and extends beyond (i.e., whether the research has been published or rejected). More specifically: 
            </p>
            <p>
                A.The expert must treat both the research and the data received from the journal,
                 the audit report, and related correspondence as confidential. These documents and their contents should not be disclosed or discussed with any individual or organization. 
            </p>
            <p>
                B.In some special cases, an expert selected by the editorial board may seek advice or guidance from another expert to facilitate the review of the paper. In such cases, the expert must
                 obtain the consent of the editorial board before sharing the contents of the manuscript and obtain editorial consent and disclose the identity of the other expert at that time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                C.An expert may publicly disclose that they have worked as an expert for the journal however, the expert should not identify himself or herself as a research expert in his or her own right. 
            </p>
            <p>
                D.In some special cases, the expert may wish to reveal his identity to the authors of the research for scientific reasons. Under these circumstances,
                 the expert must obtain prior approval from the editorial board.  The decision to disclose this information to authors is at the sole discretion of the Commission.   
            </p>
            <p>
                E.Experts should adequately explain and support their judgments so that editors and authors can understand the basis of their comments. Any statement
                 that an observation, derivation, or argument has been previously reported must 
                be accompanied by the relevant citation. Assertions not supported by experts (or authors in the appeal) are of little value and should be avoided. 
            </p>
            <p>
                F.The expert should be vigilant for authors' failure to cite relevant works by other scholars, bearing in mind that complaints that the reviewer's research has not been sufficiently cited may appear self-service. 
            </p>
            <p>
                G.The expert should draw the attention of the editorial board to any material similarity between the research under consideration and any published paper or any research submitted at the same time to another journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                7.The expert must act immediately and submit a timely report. If the expert receives a research paper at a time when circumstances prevent immediate interest in
                 the research, the research should be immediately returned to the editorial board or notify the editorial board of possible delays and suggest an alternative date. 
            </p>
            <p>
                8.Experts must not use or disclose unpublished information, arguments, or explanations contained in the research under consideration, except with the consent of the author. 
            </p>
            <p>
                9.A review of the research provided may sometimes justify criticism, and even severe criticism, from the expert. Where appropriate, such criticism may be presented in published papers.
                 However, the personal criticism of the author is in no way appropriate.
