                Journal Description: Human Sciences and Political Science

                Welcome to the Journal of Human Sciences, Political Science, and Law, a scholarly publication dedicated to exploring the complex interplay between human sciences, political science, and the field of law. Our journal provides a platform for researchers, academics, and practitioners from diverse disciplines to contribute to the advancement of knowledge at the intersection of these vital areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                We embrace a multidisciplinary approach, encouraging the submission of high-quality original research articles, theoretical studies, empirical analyses, and methodological innovations.
